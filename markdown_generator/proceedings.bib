    title = {ALOHA: An Architectural-Aware Framework for Deep Learning at the Edge},
    abstract = {Novel Deep Learning (DL) algorithms show ever-increasing accuracy and precision in multiple application domains. However, some steps further are needed towards the ubiquitous adoption of this kind of instrument. First, effort and skills required to develop newDL models, or to adapt existing ones to new use-cases, are hardly available for small- and medium-sized businesses. Second, DL inference must be brought at the edge, to overcome limitations posed by the classically-used cloud computing paradigm. This requires implementation on low-energy computing nodes, often heterogenous and parallel, that are usually more complex to program and to manage. This work describes the ALOHA framework, that proposes a solution to these issue by means of an integrated toolflow that automates most phases of the development process. The framework introduces architecture-awareness, considering the target inference platform very early, already during algorithm selection, and driving the optimal porting of the resulting embedded application. Moreover it considers security, power efficiency and adaptiveness as main objectives during the whole development process.},

    title = {Why do adversarial attacks transfer? explaining transferability of evasion and poisoning attacks},
    abstract = {Transferability captures the ability of an attack against a machine-learning model to be effective against a different, potentially unknown, model. Empirical evidence for transferability has been shown in previous work, but the underlying reasons why an attack transfers or not are not yet well understood. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis aimed to investigate the transferability of both test-time evasion and training-time poisoning attacks. We provide a unifying optimization framework for evasion and poisoning attacks, and a formal definition of transferability of such attacks. We highlight two main factors contributing to attack transferability: the intrinsic adversarial vulnerability of the target model, and the complexity of the surrogate model used to optimize the attack. Based on these insights, we define three metrics that impact an attack’s transferability. Interestingly, our results derived from theoretical analysis hold for both evasion and poisoning attacks, and are confirmed experimentally using a wide range of linear and non-linear classifiers and datasets.},

The goal of this work is to design, implement and test a system (BRB-Be Right Beach) that foster beach overcrowding avoidance and allows anyone to choose the right beach to go for having the best experience. The major requirement of our system is to have maximum accuracy (no errors, that is real-time data only are used) in the information provided to the users. The system exploits the Social Internet of Things paradigm to implement a classifier trained by a community of smartphones brought by the owners to the beaches. The BRB sensor network consists of control units equipped with a UV sensor, a thermometer, a humidity sensor and a camera for crowdedness estimation. Data are collected by a cloud platform that provides any user with information about beaches and suggestions where to go, based on users preferences like weather, crowdedness, time of travel, and so on.},

    title = {Evaluating adversarial attacks on ImageNet: A reality check on misclassification classes},
    abstract = {Although ImageNet was initially proposed as a dataset for performance benchmarking in the domain of computer vision, it also enabled a variety of other research efforts. Adversarial machine learning is one such research effort, employing deceptive inputs to fool models in making wrong predictions. To evaluate attacks and defenses in the field of adversarial machine learning, ImageNet remains one of the most frequently used datasets. However, a topic that is yet to be investigated is the nature of the classes into which adversarial examples are misclassified. In this paper, we perform a detailed analysis of these misclassification classes, leveraging the ImageNet class hierarchy and measuring the relative positions of the aforementioned type of classes in the unperturbed origins of the adversarial examples. We find that 71% of the adversarial examples that achieve model-to-model adversarial transferability are misclassified into one of the top-5 classes predicted for the underlying source images. We also find that a large subset of untargeted misclassifications are, in fact, misclassifications into semantically similar classes. Based on these findings, we discuss the need to take into account the ImageNet class hierarchy when evaluating untargeted adversarial successes. Furthermore, we advocate for future research efforts to incorporate categorical information.},

    title = {Detecting Anomalies from Video-Sequences: a Novel Descriptor},
    abstract = {We present a novel descriptor for crowd behavior analysis and anomaly detection. The goal is to measure by appropriate patterns the speed of formation and disintegration of groups in the crowd. This descriptor is inspired by the concept of one-dimensional local binary patterns: in our case, such patterns depend on the number of group observed in a time window. An appropriate measurement unit, named trit (trinary digit), represents three possible dynamic states of groups on a certain frame. Our hypothesis is that abrupt variations of the groups&apos; number may be due to an anomalous event that can be accordingly detected, by translating these variations on temporal trit-based sequence of strings which are significantly different from the one describing the no-anomaly one. Due to the peculiarity of the rationale behind this work, relying on the number of groups, three different methods of people group’s extraction are compared. Experiments are carried out on the Motion-Emotion benchmark data set. Reported results point out in which cases the trit-based measurement of group dynamics allows us to detect the anomaly. Besides the promising performance of our approach, we show how it is correlated with the anomaly typology and the camera&apos;s perspective to the crowd&apos;s flow (frontal, lateral).},

    author = {Pintor, Maura and Roli, Fabio and Brendel, Wieland and Biggio, Battista},
    abstract = {Evaluating adversarial robustness amounts to finding the minimum perturbation needed to have an input sample misclassified. The inherent complexity of the underlying optimization requires current gradient-based attacks to be carefully tuned, initialized, and possibly executed for many computationally-demanding iterations, even if specialized to a given perturbation model. In this work, we overcome these limitations by proposing a fast minimum-norm (FMN) attack that works with different ℓp-norm perturbation models (p=0,1,2,∞), is robust to hyperparameter choices, does not require adversarial starting points, and converges within few lightweight steps. It works by iteratively finding the sample misclassified with maximum confidence within an ℓp-norm constraint of size ϵ, while adapting ϵ to minimize the distance of the current sample to the decision boundary. Extensive experiments show that FMN significantly outperforms existing attacks in terms of convergence speed and computation time, while reporting comparable or even smaller perturbation sizes.},

Many defenses have been shown to provide a false sense of security by unintentionally obfuscating gradients, hindering the optimization process of gradient-based attacks. Such defenses have been subsequently shown to fail against adaptive attacks crafted to circumvent gradient obfuscation. In this work, we present Slope, a metric that detects obfuscated gradients by comparing the expected and the actual increase of the attack loss after one iteration. We show that our metric can detect the presence of obfuscated gradients in many documented cases, providing a useful debugging tool towards improving adversarial robustness evaluations.},

    title = {Indicators of Attack Failure: Debugging and Improving Optimization of Adversarial Examples},
    abstract = {Evaluating robustness of machine-learning models to adversarial examples is a challenging problem. Many defenses have been shown to provide a false sense of robustness by causing gradient-based attacks to fail, and they have been broken under more rigorous evaluations. Although guidelines and best practices have been suggested to improve current adversarial robustness evaluations, the lack of automatic testing and debugging tools makes it difficult to apply these recommendations in a systematic manner. In this work, we overcome these limitations by: (i) categorizing attack failures based on how they affect the optimization of gradient-based attacks, while also unveiling two novel failures affecting many popular attack implementations and past evaluations; (ii) proposing six novel indicators of failure, to automatically detect the presence of such failures in the attack optimization process; and (iii) suggesting a systematic protocol to apply the corresponding fixes. Our extensive experimental analysis, involving more than 15 models in 3 distinct application domains, shows that our indicators of failure can be used to debug and improve current adversarial robustness evaluations, thereby providing a first concrete step towards automatizing and systematizing them.

Those pipelines are typically orchestrated with general-purpose machine learning frameworks (e.g., Tensorflow Extended), where developers manually call the single steps for each task-specific application. The diversity of task- and technology-specific requirements in deep learning projects increases the orchestration effort. There are recent advances to automate the orchestration with machine learning, which are however, still immature and do not support task-specific applications. Hence, we claim that partial automation of pipeline orchestration with respect to specific tasks and technologies decreases the overall development effort. We verify this claim with the ALOHA tool flow, where task-specific glue code is automated. The gains of the ALOHA tool flow pipeline are evaluated with respect to human effort, computing performance, and security.},
