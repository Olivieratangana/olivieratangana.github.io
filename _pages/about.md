Olivier Atangana is a **PhD Candidate** at the [**Greyc Lab**](https://www.greyc.fr/), in the [**ENSICAEN Engineering School of Caen**](https://www.ensicaen.fr/), France, and a **Cryptocurrency Researcher** at the company [**Fime**](https://www.fime.com/fr/), France.

**RESEARCH** 

Olivier received his Engineering Degree in Computer Science and Electronics from ESIREM Engineering School-Dijon in 2022. His Ph.D. thesis, "Offline Payment Requirements FOR Central Bank Digital Currencies," delves into the intricacies of CBDCs and their potential for revolutionizing the financial sector. Olivier is a visiting lecturer in Network Security at ENSICAEN Engineering School and also contributes significantly to the academic community with publications, including 'Securing Privacy in Offline Payment for Retail CBDC: A Comprehensive Framework'

**PROJECTS** 

Olivier has collaborated with Fime on groundbreaking projects in the realm of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). His visionary approach led to the strategization and design of avant-garde CBDC use cases, including the development of an offline CBDC wallet test tool. He has also been instrumental in research endeavors, ranging from meticulous CBDC documentation studies to the creation of an Offline CBDC e-wallet.

**RECENT ACTIVITIES**

**Securing the Future Monetary System-Cybersecurity for Central Bank Digital Currencies 8-9 November 2023, Basel, Switzerland**

My attendance at the conference titled "Securing the Future Monetary System - Cybersecurity for Central Bank Digital Currencies" held on 8-9 November 2023 in Basel, Switzerland,presented a unique opportunity to engage with key figures in the field and to represent Fime‚Äôs interests and expertise.

**Day 1: Theoretical Insights and CBDC Projects**

The first day was packed with intellectual rigor. The morning sessions included enlightening keynotes and roundtable discussions, providing a deep dive into the challenges and opportunities of CBDCs. Highlight presentations included BIS‚Äôs own projects like Polaris, Sela, andTourbillon, each offering unique perspectives on secure and resilient CBDC systems. The afternoon‚Äôs technical tracks delved deeper into the specific aspects of cybersecurity in relation to CBDCs, offering a blend of theoretical and practical insights.

**Day 2: Interactive Breakout Sessions and Project Leap**

The second day began with facilitated breakout sessions, allowing for more focused discussions.
The sessions I attended, ‚ÄôCBDC and Cloud Risk/Security‚Äô and ‚ÄôOffline Payments with CBDC‚Äô,were particularly insightful. The afternoon sessions included a recap of these discussions, followed by informative keynotes. The introduction of Project Leap, aimed at quantum-proofing the financial system, was a significant highlight, marking a forward-thinking approach in the field.
In summary, the conference was a convergence of theory and practice, emphasizing the evolving role of technologies like Zero Trust, Blockchain, and AI in central banking. The
discussions around offline payments and privacy illuminated the complexity of these issues, underscoring the need for well-informed and rational public discourse.

üì¢ I'm thrilled to reflect on my recent presentation at the **Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference (B2C'2023)** in Corfu, Greece!

üîê **Privacy** stands as a cornerstone for the successful adoption of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Navigating the challenges of ensuring privacy, especially in offline payments, is no small feat. Our study delves deep into crafting an innovative protocol for CBDCs that champions both privacy and security in offline transactions.

üîç At its core, our protocol harnesses the power of **blind signature technology**, ensuring transaction data remains confidential. Complementing this, we've integrated the **zk-SNARK protocol**, ensuring transactions are private yet verifiable without any interaction between parties.

üôè A heartfelt thank you to **Greyc** and **Fime** for their unwavering support and contribution to this research. Their expertise was pivotal in shaping our findings.
