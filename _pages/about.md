**Securing the Future Monetary System-Cybersecurity for Central Bank Digital Currencies 8-9 November 2023, Basel, Switzerland**

My attendance at the conference titled "Securing the Future Monetary System - Cybersecurity for Central Bank Digital Currencies" held on 8-9 November 2023 in Basel, Switzerland,presented a unique opportunity to engage with key figures in the field and to represent Fime’s interests and expertise.

**10/17/2023**
📢 I'm thrilled to reflect on my recent presentation at the **Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference (B2C'2023)** in Corfu, Greece!

🔐 **Privacy** stands as a cornerstone for the successful adoption of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Navigating the challenges of ensuring privacy, especially in offline payments, is no small feat. Our study delves deep into crafting an innovative protocol for CBDCs that champions both privacy and security in offline transactions.

🔍 At its core, our protocol harnesses the power of **blind signature technology**, ensuring transaction data remains confidential. Complementing this, we've integrated the **zk-SNARK protocol**, ensuring transactions are private yet verifiable without any interaction between parties.

🙏 A heartfelt thank you to **Greyc** and **Fime** for their unwavering support and contribution to this research. Their expertise was pivotal in shaping our findings.
