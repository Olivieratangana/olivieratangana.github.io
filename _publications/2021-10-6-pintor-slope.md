excerpt: 'Evaluating adversarial robustness is a challenging problem. Many defenses have been shown to provide a false sense of security by unintentionally obfuscating gradients, hindering the optimization process of gradient-based attacks. Such defenses have been subsequently shown to fail against adaptive attacks crafted to circumvent gradient obfuscation. In this work, we present Slope, a metric that detects obfuscated gradients by comparing the expected and the actual increase of the attack loss after one iteration. We show that our metric can detect the presence of obfuscated gradients in many documented cases, providing a useful debugging tool towards improving adversarial robustness evaluations.'

Evaluating adversarial robustness is a challenging problem. Many defenses have been shown to provide a false sense of security by unintentionally obfuscating gradients, hindering the optimization process of gradient-based attacks. Such defenses have been subsequently shown to fail against adaptive attacks crafted to circumvent gradient obfuscation. In this work, we present Slope, a metric that detects obfuscated gradients by comparing the expected and the actual increase of the attack loss after one iteration. We show that our metric can detect the presence of obfuscated gradients in many documented cases, providing a useful debugging tool towards improving adversarial robustness evaluations.
